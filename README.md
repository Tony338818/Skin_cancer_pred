# Skin_cancer_pred

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting skin cancer types based on medical imaging data. The model leverages deep learning techniques to classify skin lesions into various categories, aiding early detection and diagnosis.

Key Features:
Model Architecture: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for image classification tasks.
Dataset: Trained on publicly available skin lesion datasets, such as the ISIC dataset.
Performance: Achieves [X% accuracy] and [Y% precision/recall] on validation data.
